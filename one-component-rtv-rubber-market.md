<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The One-Component RTV Rubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Addition Type</li><li>Condensation Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>One-Component RTV (Room Temperature Vulcanizing) rubber is classified into two main types: addition type and condensation type. Addition type RTV rubber cures through a reaction between siloxane polymers and curing agents, producing no byproducts, resulting in a clean process. In contrast, condensation type RTV rubber cures by releasing small amounts of byproducts, often resulting in a more flexible final product. Both types are used in various applications, including sealing, molding, and automotive industries, but they differ in their chemical properties and curing processes.</p></p>
