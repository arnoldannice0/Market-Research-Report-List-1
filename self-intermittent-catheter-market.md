<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-intermittent Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated Self-intermittent Catheter</li><li>Non Coated Self-intermittent Catheter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-intermittent catheter market is divided into two main types: coated and non-coated self-intermittent catheters. Coated self-intermittent catheters feature a hydrophilic or antimicrobial coating that reduces friction and minimizes the risk of urinary tract infections, enhancing patient comfort and safety. In contrast, non-coated self-intermittent catheters are typically made of rigid materials without any additional coatings, making them simpler and often more cost-effective, but may present higher risks of irritation and infection during use. Both types serve distinct patient needs and preferences.</p></p>
