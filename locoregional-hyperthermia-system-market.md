<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Locoregional Hyperthermia System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Heat Delivery System</li><li>Internal Heat Delivery System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Locoregional Hyperthermia System market includes two primary types: External Heat Delivery Systems and Internal Heat Delivery Systems. External systems use non-invasive methods, such as microwave or radiofrequency energy, to heat targeted tissues from outside the body, often used for superficial or deep-seated tumors. Internal systems involve invasive techniques, like probes or catheters, to deliver heat directly to specific areas, typically for localized or deeper tumors. Both aim to enhance cancer treatment efficacy by increasing tumor sensitivity to therapies like radiation or chemotherapy.</p></p>
